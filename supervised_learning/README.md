# Supervised learning

I present here a data science supervised study (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) that I have performed (based on the knowledge and skills I developed at Galavanize during the Data Science Immersive, April 2016). I wrote this notebook as a reference on how to perform a supervised data science study.
